## These are the steps that we need to take in doing machine learning problem.



    1. First thing we do is define what is a problem the we're trying to solve.
        
   > Look at the big picture.
    

    2. To collect the data that is required for us to train our machine model.
    
    
   > Collect data
    
    
    3. Look at the data, visualized and gained insights.

   > Visaulized and gained insights
    
    
    4. Finally, we clean up and prepprocess our data and make our data ready for our machine learning algorithms.

   > Preprocessed data for Machine Learning ingestion

#### So the four steps would be the first steps that we would do to before Machine Learning.



    5. Pick our machine learning Models


    6. Train our ML model with the prepared data
    
    
    7. Fine tune the ML model
    
    
    8. See and present our model as an interal part of an application.

1. Training Data



2. Validation Data



3. Test Data
